## üß† Project Overview

- **Mission**: Enable real-time autonomous navigation for inland/coastal USV operations
- **Core Components**: Stereo camera, LiDAR, RTK-GPS, IMU, Jetson Nano
- **Software Stack**: ROS, MOOS-IvP, C++, Python

The system employs multi-sensor fusion for dynamic obstacle detection and navigation using a custom ESA (Environmental Situational Awareness) layer. It was tested in real-world deployments in both simulation and physical river environments.
