# Suraya USV – Autonomous Navigation and Perception System

This repository contains the architecture and implementation of an intelligent perception and navigation framework for Suraya USV platforms. The system integrates stereo vision, LiDAR, GPS, and IMU for real-time autonomous navigation in inland and coastal environments.

## 🧠 Overview
- Real-time situational awareness via multi-sensor fusion
- ESA (Environmental Situational Awareness) module for collision avoidance
- Navigation and path planning using MOOS-IvP framework

## 🔧 Key Features
- Stereo vision + LiDAR fusion for obstacle detection
- GPS/IMU-based localization
- MOOS-IvP mission behavior integration
- Modular architecture using ROS and C++

## 🧪 Applications
- Hydrographic survey
- Environmental monitoring
- Autonomous maritime missions
